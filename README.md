# Multiple PDF Chat Application Using RAG Architecture with LangChain

## Overview

This project is a **Multiple PDF Chat Application** that allows users to interact with and query multiple PDF documents through a chat interface. It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by retrieving information from the PDF content and generating answers using a language model.

The application is implemented in **Python** using the **LangChain** framework, which simplifies building applications with LLMs and retrieval components.

## Features

- Load and process multiple PDF documents
- Extract text and embed content for efficient retrieval
- Use a vector store for fast similarity search over the PDFs
- Query the documents through a chat interface
- Use RAG architecture combining retrieval and generation for precise answers
- Easy to extend for other document types or LLM providers
